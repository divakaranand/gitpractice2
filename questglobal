1.We are responsible for setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, ensuring that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to different environments.

2. We use tools like Terraform or Ansible based on ART technical team selection to define infrastructure components (servers, networks, databases) as code. This allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure provisioning.

3. We integrate unit tools like JUnit or pytest to execute unit tests with CI/CD  and Security testing tools SonarQube as per requirements. 

4. Facilitate communication between development and operations teams, promoting a culture of collaboration.
